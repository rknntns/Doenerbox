## Deployment

For production deployment, consider the following steps:

1. **Configure a Reverse Proxy:**
   Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to manage requests, enable SSL, and secure the application.

2. **Domain and SSL Setup:**
   If you have a domain, point it to the server's IP address. Use Let's Encrypt or a similar service to obtain an SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS.

3. **Security Considerations:**
   Review and implement security measures, including firewall settings, system updates, user permissions, and securing access points.

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   Implement monitoring and logging to track performance and ensure the integrity of your application.
